✍️ _**Writing**_ has been my passion since I was **4 years old**. I’ve been writing novels ever since, especially _**psychological**_ ones. 📖🧠

* Parties and fast food make me feel sick (not literally).
* I’m obsessed with healthy eating.
* As a child, I spoke four languages:
    * Spanish 🇨🇴
    * English 🇺🇸
    * Portuguese 🇧🇷
    * Japanese 🇯🇵 

But the obsession to do and know everything, the time expend it to practice them was _**0**_. So japanese 愛 is no longer an understood language to me. In adittion, my english and portuguese skills decreased significantly.
