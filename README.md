# Greeting Alert!

I'm a Bachelor on **Business manegement.** 📈 💼 I am currently learning coding and improving my english skills at _**Riwi**_. My top languages on coding are:
###
* Kotlin 🇰
* JavaScript 🇯‌🇸‌
* Java ♨️

But learning Python is one of my goals, so I can fall in love with it.

On weekends my time is spent on politics at U's party 🏛️📜⚖️🎓.

✍📝_**Writing**_ is my passion since I was **4 years old**, and I started writing novels since then (especially psycologicals). 📖𝚿🧠

As a life project, I'm making a professional script for a streaming serie🎬, where all my past novels are mixed up. Everyday I work on it at least **4 hours**, even if the resting time or hobbies are sacrificed.

### Hobbies: 🎨🖌️🌿✨🎧

* Videogames 🎮🕹️👾
* Calisthenics 🏋🏽🔥💪🏼🎧
* Cardio workout 🏃
* Taekwondo 🥋

### Random facts

* Parties and fast foods make me sick _(not literal)_
* Eating healthy food like an **obseessed madman** is an always.
* As a kid I spoke 4 languages: 
    * Spanish 🇨🇴
    * English 🇺🇸
    * Portuguese 🇧🇷
    * Japanese 🇯🇵 

But the obsession to do and know everything, the time expend it to practice them was _**0**_. So japanese 愛 is no longer an understood language to me. In adittion, my english and portuguese skills decreased almost like a newbie.
