# Greeting Alert!

I'm a Bachelor on **Business manegement.** I am currently learning coding and improving my english skills at _**Riwi**_. My top languages on coding are:
###
* Kotlin
* JavaScript
* Java

But learning python is one of my goals, so I can fall in love with it.

On weekends my time is spent on politics at U's party.

_**Writing**_ is my passion since I was **4 years old**, and I started writing novels since then (especially psycologicals).

As a life project, I'm making a script for a professional streaming serie, where all my past novels are mixed up. Everyday I work on it at least **4 hours**, even if the resting time or hobbies are sacrificed.

### Hobbies:

* Videogames
* Calisthenics
* Cardio workout
* Taekwondo 

### Random facts

* Parties and fast foods make me sick _(not literal)_
* Eating healthy food like an **obseessed madman** is an always.
* As a kid I spoke 4 languages: 
    * Spanish
    * English
    * Portuguese
    * Japanese

But the obsession to do and know everything, the time expend it to practice them was _**0**_. So japanese is no longer an understood language to me. In adittion, my english and portuguese skills decreased almost like a newbie.
